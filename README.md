The corona plague broke out about two years ago and has increased the feeling of loneliness in many people, especially adults who are forced to avoid family and social gatherings in order to maintain their health. Therefore in this project, I built a website for my grandmother. 

The website is built in HTTP5, CSS3, and JS and contains:

- Pictures. 
- Playlist of music from YouTube.
- Option to like a Facebook page.
- Option to scan QR that leads to the site.
- Option to contact us via email - using the formspree website for sending the email.
- Questions and Answers about the difference between web1, web2, and web3.
